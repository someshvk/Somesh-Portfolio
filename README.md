## 📑 Read This
<p>
  I have created this React portfolio by coding a customized webpack config, so for people looking to build such a project I would recommend to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDpxqopXd9U" target="_blank">this</a> over YouTube. Also I have taken a lot of reference from <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html" target="_blank">React Docs</a> to implement React.<br><br>
  I have kept this repo public so that others could view my code and try there own way. Also I would appreciate if anybody wants to give their feedback on my portfolio.<br><br>
  You can fork this repo, also raise any issue you want to and we would figure it out. You can also contact me over my social for any query.
